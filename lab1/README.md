## Getting Started
I created a page using Bootstrap 4.
We can include the framework in 2 ways:
* Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com
* Include Bootstrap from a CDN

I chose the second option:<br />
Advantages:
* It can be loaded from cache
* The requests will be served from the server closest to the user.
* Faster content delivery to the web browsers.

Disadvantages:
* Adds complexity to your website and deployment procedures.
* Requires internet connection.

## Bootstrap grid
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.<br />
I used the grid to arrange the course thumbnails.<br />
I allocated equal amount of space for them using 'col-md-4'

## NavBar
The navbar is fixed to top and collapses when zoomed in.
It has a 'Home' link, 2 additional links and a search field.

## Responsiveness
Bootstrap was created specially for responsive, mobile-first websites.<br />
Using it's built-in classes I got a flexible page which will look good on different devices or browsers.
